<p align="justify">
I am pursuing the M.A. Candidate in Banking and Finance (MBF) at the University of St Gallen with an exchange at Seoul National University (SNU). Within my postgraduate studies I focus on quantitative methods since I am passionate about assessing behavioural puzzles with a data-driven approach. Here, I want to share and provide some insight into the projects I have been working on.

I am pursuing the M.A. Candidate in Banking and Finance (MBF) at the University of St Gallen with an exchange at Seoul National University (SNU). I am passionate about assessing behavioural puzzles with a data-driven approach. Thus, I want to share and provide some insight into the projects I have been working on.
